Reflection of project week 1

I found the project fun as i inspected the example given wiuth the SpaceY site and used that as an inspiration for my own creation trying to also include the stretcvh goals where that i could.

I found I struggled with why the home link did't return to the top after stepping away I realised it was a simple typo.
my biggest difficulty was in tryting to be more grandiose that was required but again stepping back brought me back to a grounding.
ANother issue was creating a logo unique to my creation and then adjusting it by size so that itfit within the header nicely.

I then his a road block I was trying to embed a music track but I just couldn't get it on there hidden and to autoplay.
